# Event Module for Drupal 10

## Challenge: Create a Simple Custom Drupal Events Website with Custom Modules

### Objective

Develop a Drupal module that enhances the functionality of a Drupal site by providing a custom content type, along with necessary functionality to display, manage, and interact with this content type.

### Requirements

1. **Drupal Initialization**: Using Composer, ensure that the Drupal site is configured with config export functionality (`drush cim`, `drush cex`).

2. **Multilingual Support**: Create the site with English and German language support, ensuring content can be cloned from one language to another.

3. **Custom Content Type**: The module creates a custom content type named "Event" with fields for Title, Description, Date, Location, Image (optional), Organizer, Artists (custom field), and Event Website.

   - **Artists Field**: This is a custom, multi-select, sortable select field populated with values from a JSON file.

4. **Overview Page**: An overview page displays all events sorted by date, featuring title, date, location, and organizer. It includes pagination for lists exceeding 10 events.

5. **Single Event Page**: Detailed event pages provide comprehensive information and utilize a custom theme called "Events Challenge" based on Twig templates.

6. **Event Image Upload**: The module allows for optional image uploads for events, displayed on both list and single event pages.

7. **Extend Event Website Field**: The Event Website field includes a link target selection feature in the backend, enabled through custom module configuration.

8. **API Endpoint**: A RESTful API endpoint (`/api/events`) has been created to list all events with all fields in JSON format, sorted by date.

### Installation

Local Development Environment Setup
To get started with the Event module on your local development environment using Lando, follow these instructions:

Import Database
If you have a database dump file, import it using the command below (replace filename.sql with the actual name of your database file):
`lando db-import filename.sql`

Final Checks
Ensure all the requirements listed in the previous sections have been met.
Verify that the site functions as expected and that all configurations have been imported correctly.
